/* Sketch for "Cabin in the forest".
Based on the library DFPlayerMini_Fast by PowerBroker2:
https://github.com/PowerBroker2/DFPlayerMini_Fast/blob/master/src/DFPlayerMini_Fast.h

Simulating a cabin without electricity; candle lights, oven and outside chandelier.
Using LEDs made for simulating flames
Version 2 is including playing music from a "bluetooth speaker" in the cabin.
Version RX has added functionality to control sound and light using a R/C radio.

Created for and used on an Arduino Nano Every.
